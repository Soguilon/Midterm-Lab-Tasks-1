# [Midterm Lab Task 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19071685/Midterm.Lab.Task.1.xlsx)
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset consists of multiple related tables, each designed to improve data organization and eliminate redundancy.

## Step by Step Process
Step 1:
- Load the raw file
- Fix columns width and height
- TRIM words and spaces
- Remove Null values
- Remove Duplicates

Step 2:
- Performed 1NF
- Performed Table spilt using 2NF
- Performed 2NF
- Mapped the normalization as a physical data model


Step 3: Here's the screenshot of my output before I started data cleaning (see screenshot)
